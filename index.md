This lesson will encompass everything we have been working throughout this workshop, running a rather complex analysis on a public cloud vendor to run heavy duty tasks. We are scratching only the surface of the potential of this tool, but this lesson lays a strong foundation of how to run realistic physics analysis in GCP using kubernetes.

If you run into problems with any of these steps, please reach out to the organizers through the [Mattermost channel for the workshop](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/cmsodws2022/channels/cloud-computing-lesson).
